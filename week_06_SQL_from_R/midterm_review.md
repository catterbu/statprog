Midterm
========================================================

The questions for the midterm exam will be collected from your github pages. If your pages do not parse correctly (or if they don't exist), your questions will not be used.

You will be graded by a robot

* We will use a script to check that you have a sufficient number of questions, and that they are properly formatted.

* Robots are cruel.
